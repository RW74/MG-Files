# Some older games ignore the d-pad. Explicitly mapping the dpad to the left
# stick is also good for games that should let the user use either the dpad
# or left stick, but don't support it for one reason or another.
# Examples include Atomic Bomberman, Megabyte Punch, and Lethal League.
#gamepad.left = -left_x
#gamepad.right = +left_x
#gamepad.up = -left_y
#gamepad.down = +left_y
gamepad.leftright = left_x
gamepad.updown = left_y
